#summary Windows apps we are thinking about adding to wisotool

Don't add titles here that you're already looking at - this is
a reminder list for things we want to look at in the near future.

When you add a title, please include links to appdb if possible.

== Criteria ==

We like games that are very popular/good/recent.

I usually check Wikipedia for release dates (ancient games unlikely to interest people unless they're great and/or are free downloads),
Gamerankings.com for a measure of "good" (70% or higher is ok, 90% is "do it now!")
and amazon to see if it's selling (if it's in the top 100 in some category,
that's a good sign).

But even if it doesn't meet those criteria, and you love the game, go ahead.

== GOG titles ==

http://www.gog.com/en/forum/general/gog_games_that_are_working_fine_with_linux_wine
has a list of the ones that work.  We removed GOG support when they shut down
recently (see http://code.google.com/p/winezeug/source/detail?r=1600 ), but now that they're back, we should revert r1600 and update it to work with the new GOG.com.

== Demo/release lists ==
Sometimes you can find fresh game demos at these sites... 
the earlier we can QA them and file bugs, the sooner wine can support them.

http://www.bigdownload.com/downloads?fileId=1&orderType=update&genreId=0

http://www.ign.com/index/release.html

== Youtube Channels about Wine and Games ==
(Hey, if it runs well enough to make a video about, we should probably support it!)

== Blogs about Wine and Games ==

http://www.steamgamesonlinux.com/category/playable-steam-games/
(assuming we ever get steam reliably scripted, that is)

== Other Wine Frontends ==
(PlayOnLinux supports about 250 games.  If it works for them, we can probably script it.)

http://www.playonlinux.com/repository/?cat=1

Wine-Doors supports a dozen or so games, might be worth looking at, even though
the project is shut down.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine-Doors

Likewise, WineBot supported a dozen or so titles, and even used Autohotkey to do it:

== Proposed free titles ==

Joerg requests that we add one or more of the titles in
http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15030
since that exposes an installer hang.

His gf says these are her favorite five games from bigfish:
  World Mosaics (1, 2 and 3)
  Grimms Hatchery
  Life Quest
  Farmers Market
  Santa's Super Friends
Only the last one doesn't work in Wine.  If bigfish's installer is too annoying,
try looking for them at sandlotgames, perhaps.

== Game development IDEs ==

http://www.gamestart3d.com  (said to work quite well in wine)

== Codecs ==

(for winetricks)

http://www.cccp-project.net looks like a reasonable nearly open source codec distribution?
http://www.cccp-project.net/beta/ has archives of the patches they apply.
Not sure whether they publish the source for their installer, etc.
